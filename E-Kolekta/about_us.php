        <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
        <p>E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electronic devices or components that are no longer useful, working, or wanted. This includes mobile phones, televisions, laptops, cables, batteries, chargers, and more.
        Improper disposal leads to pollution of soil and water, affects the health of nearby communities, and wastes valuable materials that can still be recycled or reused. E-waste is one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally, making responsible recycling more urgent than ever.</p>
